// applyUpdate() downloads the image over HTTPS, computes its SHA-256 while
// streaming it into the idle app partition, and only lets that partition
// become bootable if the digest matches the one the server sent. Any failure
// (bad hash, timeout, flash error) leaves the running firmware untouched.
// Runs on the MQTT task (core 0), never on the watchdog-registered loop task,
// so the display and serial links keep running during the download.
//
// The safety net against a bad build is the boot trial (checkBootRollback /
// confirmBootHealthy, see ota_rollback_logic.h): an OTA image that never gets
// itself onto MQTT within three boots is replaced by the previous one.
